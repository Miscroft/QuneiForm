# GANG-SLANG
GANG SLANG (G$)
 is an esoteric programmimg language (esolang) with some properties:
1. Zipper bags are first-class citizens.
2. CV (complex variable) is VC (vector calculous). VC is CV. (Not achieved yet.)
3. Just as "LOGO" is known (by kids) as "turtle programming", G$ is also well-known (by me) as "drug-dealing programming." 
   One may learns how to program in the processes of drug dealing .
   
HOW TO USE GANG SLANG DRUG DEALER SYSTEM ( called "dealing system" in  following) ?                              
Excecute "GANG SLANG.exe" and follow the handbook to type "GESTURES" - the only orders accepted in dealing system. 
The format is like: separated gestures with "space" and end with "tab":

                                   [gesture1][space][gesture2][space][\n]
                                   [gestures3][space][numbers or characters][space][\n]
                                   [\t]

For example, if you pay $100 and put 3.14 grams of marijuana in 1st zipper bag, you should:

                                   =[C] 
                                   >|< 3.14 
                                   (\t)
				   
You may also write "GESTURES" or EMOJIS in SHOPPINGLIST.htm, and then use gestures "=lE#" (for "GESTURES") and "=A=" (for EMOJIS) to let dealing system identify.
