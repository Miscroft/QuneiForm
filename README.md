# QuneiForm

  Imagine how do you , a Sumerian , buy things in B.C. 3200 . Now you have currency: 
[I] (1 buck), [V] (5 bucks), [X] (10 bucks), [L] (50 bucks), [C] (100 bucks)
and then you wanna buy some “magic” vegetables of FIRST bag within 1050(50*21), so you talk to dealer in store of market , so you “write” shopping list on mud block like:

    [X] [V] => 
	
(I PAY 15 BUCKS FOR THIS )
but actually this only cost you 13 BUCKS, for example, so you “write” again :

	[I] [I] <=
	

(2 BUCKS IN CHANGE)

  Now you can feel you are a REAL SUMERIAN!! OK, now we can use cuneiform as a programming language to do something. There must be a space in WORDS, don’t forget!!
